# NBA-Machine-Learning-Competition
This is my code file for a machine learning competition at UT Austin for undergraduate BAX and MIS majors. 

In this code file I worked with 5 different machine learning models: 
Decision Trees, Bagging Models, Random Forests, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and K Nearest Neighbors.

Additionally, I utilized feature engineering, grid search, comparing ROC AUC scores between models, correlation matrices, variable filtering, and train test splitting to produce the random forest model that produced the highest profit of $3,000,000+ winning first place.
